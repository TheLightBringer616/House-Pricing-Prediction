# House-Pricing-Prediction
**Prediction of House Prices with a regression model** <br>
The data used was taken from the House Prices competition in kaggle

As we all know House Prices can be affected by several factors such as the year it was built, how many rooms/bathrooms does it have, if it have a basement, among other things. In this work after applying different treatments to the original data we found that the **5 most important features** are the following: <br>

**The total home quality** <br>
**The year it was built** <br>
**The total rooms above ground (above the basement)** <br>
**The total number of bathrooms** <br>
**The area of the rooms (dimensions)** <br>

<br>

In this repository you will find the dataset used, a file tbat describes the meaning of the data, a jupyter-notebook and a HTML file which contain the whole process of the regression analysis. <br>

In this work we cover:
## Data Cleansing

## EDA

## Feature Engineering

## Features Transformation

## Target Transformation

## Endcode and Scale Data

## Data Selection

## Model Selection

## Hyperparameter Optimization

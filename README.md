# House-Pricing-Prediction
**Prediction of House Prices with a regression model** <br>
The data used was taken from the House Prices competition in kaggle

As we all know House Prices can be affected by several factors such as the year it was built, how many rooms/bathrooms does it have, the quality of the house, among other things. In this work after applying different treatments to the original data we found that the most important features are the ones that we expect to impact more on the House Prices (The ones that we already mentioned). <br>

In this repository you will find the dataset used, a file tbat describes the meaning of the data, a jupyter-notebook which contains the regression analysis among other things and a copy of the jupyter-nootebook in HTML format.

**Message: Soon a presentation with the results will be uploaded to the repository.**

In this work we cover:
## Data Cleansing

## EDA

## Feature Engineering

## Features Transformation

## Target Transformation

## Endcode and Scale Data

## Data Selection
## Model Selection

## Hyperparameter Optimization
